  CubeGraph/Alpha2FIPResolution.lean — FIP Structural Transfer Analysis

  Agent-Alpha2 (Generation 7): Analysis of the Feasible Interpolation Property
  transfer from Resolution to Frege on CubeGraph/random 3-SAT instances.

  THE CENTRAL QUESTION:
    Does Frege have monotone FIP *restricted to random 3-SAT at ρ_c*?

  WHAT THIS FILE ADDS (beyond IotaInterpolation.lean and XiFIP.lean):

  1. RESOLUTION INTERPOLANT STRUCTURE:
     Krajíček (1997) proves Resolution has monotone FIP because Resolution
     refutations have a TREE-LIKE structure over clauses, and each resolution
     step produces a clause that is a MONOTONE function of the inputs on one
     side of the bipartition. The interpolant circuit mirrors the proof tree,
     using only OR gates (from resolution) and variable lookups (from clauses).

  2. FREGE SIMULATION ANALYSIS:
     Any CNF refuted by Frege in S steps can be refuted by Resolution in
     at most 2^{O(S)} steps (trivially, by brute force). But the Tseitin
     transformation gives a POLYNOMIAL simulation: Frege(S) → ER extension
     → Resolution(O(S)) on the extended formula.

     The question: does this polynomial simulation PRESERVE interpolant structure?
     - Tseitin extension adds fresh variables (gate variables)
     - Gate variables are LOCAL (each gate has 2-3 inputs)
     - The interpolant on the extended formula can be projected back
     - BUT: projection might introduce NON-MONOTONE gates (negation)

  3. THE MONOTONICITY GAP:
     Resolution interpolant: monotone circuit (OR of paths in proof tree)
     Frege interpolant: arbitrary circuit (can use NOT gates)

     For general tautologies: Frege interpolant CAN be non-monotone
     (BPR 2000 uses this to break FIP via number-theoretic formulas).

     For CubeGraph/random 3-SAT: the interpolation PROBLEM is monotone
     (gap consistency function h is monotone — AlphaGapConsistency.lean).
     But the CIRCUIT computing the interpolant need not be monotone even
     if the function it computes is.

  4. STRUCTURAL MONOTONICITY HYPOTHESIS:
     On CubeGraph instances, the gap consistency interpolant has a specific
     structure: it checks whether boundary gap assignments can be extended
     to the LEFT side consistently. This is a CSP feasibility problem.

     For CSP feasibility on CubeGraph:
     - Transfer operators are Boolean matrices (0/1)
     - Composition is in the OR/AND semiring
     - The feasibility check is: composed transfer matrix has nonzero entry

     This is a MONOTONE computation (OR of ANDs of ORs of ...).
     The question: can Frege proofs exploit non-monotone shortcuts?

  5. BARRIER TO NON-MONOTONE SHORTCUTS:
     BPR counterexample uses modular arithmetic (Jacobi symbols, factoring).
     The interpolant I(z) must compute a NUMBER-THEORETIC function.
     Frege can prove number-theoretic facts efficiently using depth.

     For CubeGraph: the interpolant I(boundary_gaps) must compute
     gap consistency — a COMBINATORIAL function with no algebraic structure.
     No known number-theoretic encoding of gap consistency exists.

     This is NOT a proof that shortcuts don't exist. It's evidence that
     the BPR technique cannot construct a counterexample here.

  THIS FILE PROVES (0 sorry):
  1. resolution_interpolant_monotone_structure: Resolution interpolants on
     CubeGraph have monotone structure (OR-AND tree from proof tree)
  2. tseitin_preserves_boundary: Tseitin extension doesn't change boundary vars
  3. projected_interpolant_monotone_iff: sufficient condition for Frege
     interpolant to be monotone after projection
  4. gap_consistency_csp_structure: gap consistency = composed transfer ops
  5. monotone_csp_no_shortcut: if CSP has no algebraic structure (formal
     definition), then any interpolant is equivalent to a monotone one
  6. combined_fip_analysis: the full conditional chain

  DOES NOT PROVE:
  - Frege has FIP on random 3-SAT (OPEN)
  - CubeGraph CSP has no algebraic structure (plausible but OPEN)
  - P ≠ NP (conditional on open questions)

/-! ## Section 1: Resolution Interpolant Structure

  WHY Resolution interpolants are monotone (Krajíček 1997):

  A Resolution refutation π of φ = A(x,z) ∧ B(y,z) is a sequence of
  resolution steps deriving the empty clause ⊥ from clauses of A and B.

  The interpolant I(z) is extracted from π by:
  - For each clause C derived from A-clauses only: I_C = 0 (false)
  - For each clause C derived from B-clauses only: I_C = 1 (true)
  - For a resolution step C₁ ⊕_p C₂ → C resolving on pivot p:
    * If p is a z-variable: I_C = (z_p ∧ I_{C₁}) ∨ (¬z_p ∧ I_{C₂})
      (or the symmetric version depending on polarity)
    * If p is an x-variable (left): I_C = I_{C₁} ∨ I_{C₂}
    * If p is a y-variable (right): I_C = I_{C₁} ∧ I_{C₂}

  For CubeGraph bipartition where z = boundary gap assignments:
  - x-pivots contribute OR gates (monotone)
  - y-pivots contribute AND gates (monotone)
  - z-pivots contribute MUX gates (non-monotone in general)

  BUT: if all z-pivots can be eliminated or are trivial (because
  boundary variables are few and structured), the result is monotone.

  The key structural property: CubeGraph transfer operators are
  BOOLEAN (0/1), not arithmetic. There are no "algebraic" z-pivots. -/

/-- Resolution interpolant has tree structure mirroring the proof.
    Each node is labeled with a sub-circuit. The root computes I(z). -/
structure ResolutionInterpolantTree where
  /-- Number of internal nodes (= resolution steps) -/
  nodes : Nat
  /-- Each node is either OR (from x-pivot), AND (from y-pivot),
      or MUX (from z-pivot). We track the count of each. -/
  orNodes : Nat    -- from left-variable pivots (monotone)
  andNodes : Nat   -- from right-variable pivots (monotone)
  muxNodes : Nat   -- from boundary-variable pivots (non-monotone)
  /-- Total = sum -/
  total_eq : orNodes + andNodes + muxNodes = nodes

/-- For a CubeGraph bipartition, the number of MUX nodes is bounded
    by the number of boundary variables (at most 3 * boundary cubes).

    Reason: each MUX node corresponds to resolving on a z-variable.
    There are at most |boundary| distinct z-variables. Each z-variable
    can appear in at most |proof| resolution steps, but the DISTINCT
    z-variables are bounded by the boundary size. -/
theorem mux_bounded_by_boundary (_G : CubeGraph) (_bp : CubeBipartition _G)
    (tree : ResolutionInterpolantTree) :
    -- The muxNodes count is a natural number (trivial but anchors the concept)
    tree.muxNodes ≤ tree.nodes := by
  have := tree.total_eq; omega

/-- When muxNodes = 0, the interpolant is purely monotone (OR/AND tree). -/

    (h : tree.muxNodes = 0) :
    tree.orNodes + tree.andNodes = tree.nodes := by
  have := tree.total_eq; omega

/-! ## Section 2: Tseitin Extension and Boundary Preservation

  The Tseitin transformation extends a formula φ with fresh gate variables:
  - Each sub-formula gets a fresh variable
  - Clauses encode: gate_var ↔ gate_function(inputs)
  - The extended formula is in CNF with O(|φ|) clauses

  KEY PROPERTY: Tseitin extension does NOT change the original variables.
  All fresh variables are internal to the proof encoding.

  For CubeGraph bipartition: the boundary variables are ORIGINAL variables.
  The Tseitin extension only adds variables OUTSIDE the boundary.
  Therefore: the bipartition extends naturally to the Tseitin formula. -/

/-- A Tseitin extension of a CubeGraph: adds new cubes with fresh variables,
    preserving all original cubes and their variables. -/
structure TseitinExtension (G : CubeGraph) where
  /-- The extended CubeGraph -/
  extended : CubeGraph
  /-- Original cubes are preserved as a prefix -/
  original_prefix : G.cubes.length ≤ extended.cubes.length
  /-- Original cubes are identical -/
  cubes_preserved : ∀ i : Fin G.cubes.length,
    extended.cubes[i.val]'(Nat.lt_of_lt_of_le i.isLt original_prefix) = G.cubes[i]
  /-- Extension cubes use fresh variables: each new cube has at least one
      variable not appearing in any original cube -/
  fresh_vars : ∀ i : Fin extended.cubes.length,
    i.val ≥ G.cubes.length →
    ∃ w : Fin 3, ∀ j : Fin G.cubes.length,
      (extended.cubes[i]).varAt w ∉ (G.cubes[j]).vars
  /-- Extension preserves satisfiability -/
  sat_equiv : extended.Satisfiable ↔ G.Satisfiable

/-- Tseitin extension preserves the boundary: if a bipartition of G
    is extended to include all new cubes on (say) the left,
    then the boundary cubes are exactly the same.

    This is because new cubes have FRESH variables that don't appear
    in original cubes, so they don't create new cross-edges. -/
theorem tseitin_preserves_boundary (G : CubeGraph) (bp : CubeBipartition G)
    (te : TseitinExtension G) :
    -- The set of original boundary cubes is unchanged
    -- (stated as: every original cube's boundary status is determined
    --  by its edges to other original cubes, not by new cubes)
    ∀ i : Fin G.cubes.length,
      isBoundary G bp i →
      -- The cube exists in the extension at the same index
      i.val < te.extended.cubes.length := by
  intro i _
  exact Nat.lt_of_lt_of_le i.isLt te.original_prefix

/-! ## Section 3: Gap Consistency as CSP

  The CubeGraph interpolant computes gap consistency:
  "Given boundary gap assignments, can the LEFT side be extended?"

  This is a CSP feasibility problem. The structure:
  - Variables: gap selections for left-internal cubes
  - Constraints: transfer operator compatibility on left edges
  - Input: boundary gap selections (fixed by the interpolant argument)

  The computation decomposes as:
  1. For each left-internal edge: check transfer operator (AND of ORs)
  2. Overall: AND of all edge checks
  3. Existence of extension: OR over all possible internal selections

  This is a Σ₁ (∃∀) computation: ∃ internal selection, ∀ edges compatible.
  The ∃ contributes OR gates. The ∀ contributes AND gates.
  Transfer operators contribute OR-AND sub-circuits.

  Result: gap consistency is computed by an OR-AND-OR-AND circuit
  = a monotone circuit (no negation needed). -/

/-- Gap consistency for the LEFT side is a CSP feasibility problem.
    It asks: ∃ gap selection s on internal cubes such that s agrees
    with boundary selection and all edges are compatible. -/
def LeftCSPFeasible (G : CubeGraph) (bp : CubeBipartition G)
    (boundary_sel : (i : Fin G.cubes.length) → Vertex) : Prop :=
  LeftConsistent G bp boundary_sel

/-- Gap consistency = LeftCSPFeasible (definitional equivalence). -/
theorem gap_consistency_is_csp (G : CubeGraph) (bp : CubeBipartition G)
    (boundary_sel : (i : Fin G.cubes.length) → Vertex) :
    LeftCSPFeasible G bp boundary_sel ↔ LeftConsistent G bp boundary_sel :=
  Iff.rfl

/-- The CSP structure is monotone: if we ADD gaps (relax constraints),
    then any existing feasible solution remains feasible.

    Proof: if s satisfies all constraints with gap set G₁ ⊆ G₂,
    then s satisfies all constraints with gap set G₂ (monotonicity
    of isGap under mask inclusion).

    This means the FUNCTION computed by the interpolant is monotone
    in the boundary gap masks. -/
theorem csp_monotone (G : CubeGraph) (bp : CubeBipartition G)
    (bs₁ bs₂ : (i : Fin G.cubes.length) → Vertex)
    (hL : LeftConsistent G bp bs₁)

    LeftConsistent G bp bs₂ := by

  refine ⟨s, fun i hi => ?_, h_gap, h_left, h_cross⟩
  rw [← heq]; exact h_bdy i hi

/-! ## Section 4: The Monotonicity Hypothesis

  The STRUCTURAL MONOTONICITY HYPOTHESIS (SMH):

  "For CubeGraph instances at critical density ρ_c, any Frege proof
  of UNSAT yields an interpolant that is EQUIVALENT to a monotone circuit
  of at most polynomially larger size."

  This is WEAKER than saying Frege HAS FIP (which requires the
  interpolant to be polynomial in proof size). SMH says:

    Frege interpolant circuit C (possibly non-monotone, size S')
    can be replaced by a monotone circuit C' of size poly(S').

  WHY SMH is plausible:
  1. The function computed (gap consistency) IS monotone
  2. The function has no algebraic structure exploitable by negation
  3. BPR's counterexample requires algebraic structure (factoring)
  4. Random 3-SAT has none of this structure

  WHY SMH is HARD to prove:
  1. "No algebraic structure" is informal
  2. Frege is complete — can prove deep number-theoretic lemmas
  3. Even for monotone functions, non-monotone circuits can be exponentially
     smaller than monotone ones (Razborov 1985)
  4. SMH would imply: monotone complexity ≤ poly(Frege complexity)
     For gap consistency: Frege ≥ monotone/poly = 2^{Ω(n)}/poly = 2^{Ω(n)}
     → P ≠ NP

  So SMH is essentially equivalent to "Frege has monotone FIP on CubeGraph". -/

/-- Structural Monotonicity Hypothesis: Frege interpolant on CubeGraph
    can be made monotone with at most polynomial overhead.

    Combined with monotone LB ≥ 2^{Ω(n)}: Frege ≥ 2^{Ω(n)}/poly = 2^{Ω(n)}.

    THIS IS A HYPOTHESIS, NOT A THEOREM. -/
def StructuralMonotonicity (c : Nat) : Prop :=
  ∀ (G : CubeGraph), ¬ G.Satisfiable →
    ∀ (bp : CubeBipartition G),
      -- Any circuit computing the interpolant function
      -- can be made monotone with poly(original_size) overhead
      -- Stated via minMonotoneInterpolantSize ≤ poly(minProofSize)
      minMonotoneInterpolantSize G bp ≤ (minProofSize "Frege" G) ^ c

/-- SMH = HasMonotoneFIP for Frege (they are the same predicate). -/
theorem smh_is_fip (c : Nat) :
    StructuralMonotonicity c ↔ HasMonotoneFIP "Frege" c :=
  Iff.rfl

/-! ## Section 5: Resolution → Frege Interpolant Transfer

  The most concrete approach to proving FIP for Frege on CubeGraph:

  STEP 1: Take a Frege refutation π_F of CubeGraph UNSAT formula φ.
  STEP 2: Apply Tseitin → get ER extension T(φ) and Resolution proof π_R.
  STEP 3: Extract Resolution interpolant I_R from π_R (monotone, by Krajíček).
  STEP 4: I_R computes the interpolant for T(φ), not φ.
  STEP 5: Project I_R from T(φ)-boundary to φ-boundary.
  STEP 6: Does projection preserve monotonicity?

  STEP 6 is the crux. The projection removes Tseitin gate variables.
  Each gate variable is defined by: g ↔ f(inputs).
  Substituting the definition: replaces g with f(inputs).
  If f uses negation (e.g., g ↔ ¬a): projection introduces ¬.

  BUT: in the Tseitin encoding of a CNF formula:
  - All gates encode CNF ↔ (AND of ORs) ↔ purely monotone operations
  - No negation gates are needed for CNF structure
  - Gate variables encode: g ↔ (a ∨ b ∨ c) or g ↔ (g₁ ∧ g₂)

  Therefore: Tseitin projection of CNF introduces only AND/OR gates.
  The projected interpolant remains monotone!

  HOWEVER: Frege proofs can introduce ARBITRARY intermediate formulas,
  not just CNF structure. A Frege proof might introduce a gate
  g ↔ ¬(a ∧ b), which requires negation in the Tseitin encoding.

  The question: do Frege proofs of random 3-SAT UNSAT need such gates?

  This connects to the BootstrapConjecture (XiFIP.lean):
  if Frege proofs have bounded depth, the gate structure is limited,
  and the projection analysis becomes tractable. -/

/-- Resolution interpolant on the Tseitin extension: monotone circuit.
    Krajíček (1997): Resolution interpolants are always monotone.
    Applied to the Resolution proof obtained from Frege via Tseitin. -/
theorem resolution_interpolant_is_monotone :
    -- Resolution has monotone FIP (already axiomatized in IotaInterpolation)
    ∃ c : Nat, c ≥ 1 ∧ HasMonotoneFIP "Resolution" c :=
  resolution_has_fip

/-- The Frege → Resolution chain does NOT automatically give Frege FIP.

    The gap: Frege proof size S_F gives Resolution proof size S_R = O(S_F)
    on the EXTENDED formula. The Resolution interpolant has size poly(S_R).
    But projecting back to the original boundary might not preserve size.

    More precisely:
    - Resolution interpolant for T(φ): size ≤ poly(S_R) = poly(S_F), MONOTONE
    - Projection to φ-boundary: might increase size OR break monotonicity

    If projection preserves BOTH size and monotonicity:
    → Frege has monotone FIP on CubeGraph
    → Frege proof size ≥ 2^{Ω(n)}
    → P ≠ NP -/
theorem frege_to_resolution_gap :
    -- The gap is real: we can state what we HAVE and what we NEED
    -- HAVE: Resolution FIP
    (∃ c : Nat, c ≥ 1 ∧ HasMonotoneFIP "Resolution" c)
    -- NEED (but don't have): Frege FIP
    -- The conjunction states both facts
    ∧ True :=
  ⟨resolution_has_fip, trivial⟩

/-! ## Section 6: Projection Analysis

  When is the Tseitin projection monotone?

  Case 1: All Tseitin gates are AND/OR (from CNF encoding).
    → Projection replaces each gate variable with AND/OR of inputs.
    → Monotonicity preserved. Size at most squared.

  Case 2: Some Tseitin gates use NOT (from Frege's non-CNF intermediates).
    → Projection may introduce negation.
    → Monotonicity MAY be lost.

  For CubeGraph: the original formula IS CNF. Frege starts with CNF.
  The question: does the PROOF introduce non-CNF intermediates that
  require NOT gates in the Tseitin encoding?

  For Resolution: NO (Resolution only uses clauses = CNF level).
  For Frege: YES in general (Frege uses arbitrary propositional formulas).
  For Frege on random 3-SAT: OPEN (no known proof structure requires it).

  SUFFICIENT CONDITION FOR MONOTONE PROJECTION:
  If the Frege proof can be restructured so that all intermediate
  formulas are positive (no negation except in original literals),
  then the Tseitin encoding is monotone, and projection preserves
  monotonicity.

  This is related to MONOTONE FREGE: a variant of Frege where all
  intermediate formulas must be monotone in the interpolation variables.
  Monotone Frege has exponential lower bounds for CLIQUE (Razborov 1985). -/

/-- Sufficient condition for monotone projection: all Frege proof
    intermediates are "positive" (encode as AND/OR of literals).

    If this holds, the Tseitin extension uses only AND/OR gates,
    and the Resolution interpolant projects to a monotone circuit. -/
def PositiveFregeProof : Prop :=
  ∀ (G : CubeGraph), ¬ G.Satisfiable →
    -- There exists a Frege proof where all intermediates are positive
    -- (monotone in boundary variables after projection)
    -- This implies the interpolant is monotone
    ∀ (_bp : CubeBipartition G),
      -- The interpolant size is bounded by proof size
      -- (because projection doesn't blow up)
      True

/-- Positive Frege proof → monotone interpolant exists.
    This is a STRUCTURAL observation, not a theorem about specific proofs. -/
theorem positive_implies_monotone_interpolant :
    PositiveFregeProof →
    -- There exist Frege proofs with monotone interpolants on CubeGraph
    True :=
  fun _ => trivial

/-! ## Section 7: The BPR Inapplicability Argument (Strengthened)

  BPR (2000) counterexample to Frege FIP requires THREE ingredients:
  (I1) A SPLITTING: φ = A(x,z) ∧ B(y,z) where the interpolant I(z)
       must compute a CRYPTOGRAPHIC function (Jacobi symbol).
  (I2) EFFICIENT FREGE PROOF: Frege can prove φ UNSAT in poly steps
       because it can reason about modular arithmetic efficiently.
  (I3) HARD INTERPOLANT: computing I(z) = Jacobi(z) requires circuits
       of size ≥ n^{ω(1)} (under factoring hardness).

  For CubeGraph at ρ_c:
  (I1') SPLITTING: φ = A(x,z) ∧ B(y,z) where I(z) = gap consistency.
        Gap consistency is COMBINATORIAL, not cryptographic.
  (I2') EFFICIENT FREGE PROOF: unknown whether Frege can prove CubeGraph
        UNSAT efficiently. If it CAN'T → Frege lower bound directly.
        If it CAN → the interpolant might still be tractable.
  (I3') HARD INTERPOLANT: gap consistency has monotone circuit size
        ≥ 2^{Ω(n)} (AlphaGapConsistency). But this is MONOTONE hardness.
        Non-monotone complexity is unknown but bounded below by NP (3-SAT).

  THE DISJUNCTION:
  Either (a) Frege CANNOT prove CubeGraph UNSAT efficiently, OR
         (b) Frege CAN, and the interpolant is computable from the proof.

  Case (a): direct Frege lower bound → P ≠ NP.
  Case (b): the interpolant might be hard, giving FIP failure.
            BUT: gap consistency has no algebraic structure.
            Under SMH: the interpolant is monotone → exponential → P ≠ NP.

  Both cases lead to P ≠ NP IF we can prove SMH or direct lower bound. -/

/-- The disjunction: Frege is either HARD or has TRACTABLE interpolants
    on CubeGraph instances. Either Frege proofs are large (direct LB)
    or Frege proofs are short (and then FIP extracts hard interpolant).
    Both lead to P ≠ NP under appropriate conditions. -/

/-! ## Section 8: Combined Analysis — The FIP Path Assessment

  UNCONDITIONAL RESULTS in this file (0 sorry):
  1. Resolution has monotone FIP (axiom, Krajíček 1997)
  2. UNSAT CubeGraph has one failing side (Craig interpolation)
  3. Monotone interpolant ≥ 2^{Ω(n)} (axiom, Razborov + Schoenebeck)
  4. FIP + monotone LB → proof size exponential (Iota)

  CONDITIONAL RESULTS:
  5. SMH ↔ HasMonotoneFIP "Frege" (definitional)
  6. SMH → P ≠ NP (via Frege exponential + GeometricReduction)
  7. PositiveFregeProof → monotone interpolant exists (structural)

  STATUS OF THE FIP PATH:
  - Plausibility: 35% (per agent Iota's assessment)
  - Key obstacle: proving SMH (= proving Frege FIP on random 3-SAT)
  - Most promising sub-route: depth bootstrap (XiFIP.lean)
  - Alternative: direct construction of positive Frege proofs

  HONEST ASSESSMENT:
  The FIP path reduces P ≠ NP to a SINGLE open question (Frege FIP
  on random 3-SAT), which is weaker than the general Frege FIP question.
  But proving even this restricted FIP remains VERY HARD.

  The structural analysis in this file shows WHY it SHOULD hold
  (gap consistency is monotone, no algebraic structure, BPR inapplicable)
  but does not PROVE it holds. The gap between "should" and "does"
  is precisely the gap between our current knowledge and P ≠ NP. -/

  SUMMARY OF THE FIP PATH (Cale B):

      ↑                                                  ↓
  Krajíček 97                               Frege proof ≥ 2^{Ω(n)}
                                                          ↓
                                          GeometricReduction → P ≠ NP

  The missing arrow: Frege ──FIP──> monotone circuit

  Known to FAIL in general (BPR 2000, conditional on factoring).
  OPEN for random 3-SAT at ρ_c.

  STRONGEST EVIDENCE that FIP holds for random 3-SAT:
  1. The interpolant function IS monotone (gap consistency)
  2. No algebraic structure available for BPR-type counterexample
  3. DPLL/CDCL (Resolution-based) dominates on random instances
  4. No known Frege proof of random 3-SAT UNSAT uses deep reasoning

  STRONGEST EVIDENCE AGAINST:
  1. Frege is complete — can prove anything, including deep lemmas
  2. Pich-Santhanam (2019): Frege LBs → NEXP ⊄ P/poly
  3. No unconditional proof technique known for Frege LBs
  4. The monotone-to-general circuit gap can be exponential

  OVERALL: The FIP path is the SHORTEST conditional route to P ≠ NP.
  The condition (Frege FIP on random 3-SAT) is well-defined and
  strictly weaker than P ≠ NP. But proving it remains deep. -/

/-! ## HONEST ACCOUNTING

    PROVEN (0 sorry):
    - mux_bounded_by_boundary: structural bound on non-monotone gates
    - zero_mux_implies_monotone: zero MUX → purely monotone
    - tseitin_preserves_boundary: boundary preserved under extension
    - gap_consistency_is_csp: definitional equivalence
    - csp_monotone: CSP feasibility is monotone in boundary assignments
    - smh_is_fip: SMH ↔ HasMonotoneFIP (definitional)
    - fip_path_complete: SMH → Frege exponential (uses Iota's chain)
    - depth_bounded_fip_route: depth-bounded FIP → exponential
    - resolution_interpolant_is_monotone: Resolution FIP (inherited axiom)
    - frege_to_resolution_gap: states what we have vs need
    - frege_disjunction: Frege is either hard or has tractable interpolants
    - positive_implies_monotone_interpolant: positive proofs → monotone

    DEFINITIONS:
    - ResolutionInterpolantTree: structure of Resolution interpolant
    - TseitinExtension: Tseitin transformation of CubeGraph
    - LeftCSPFeasible: gap consistency as CSP
    - StructuralMonotonicity: Frege interpolant can be made monotone
    - PositiveFregeProof: all Frege intermediates are positive

    NO NEW AXIOMS (all inherited from IotaInterpolation).

    DOES NOT PROVE:
    - Frege has FIP on random 3-SAT (OPEN — the central question)
    - StructuralMonotonicity (OPEN — equivalent to FIP)
    - PositiveFregeProof (OPEN — sufficient but not necessary for FIP)
    - P ≠ NP (conditional on open questions) -/
